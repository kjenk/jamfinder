# SQL ORM Missive:
#
# Don't use models to automatically generate schemas. After iterating several
# times with SQLAlchemy (and nearly every other ORM from frameworks both long
# since dead and still trendy), to get a schema "just right" requires
# entirely too much fiddling in the ORM. My hard earned lesson: SQL is the
# right dialect to describe your database's structure (read: do not use an
# ORM to generate DDL). Other than portability, what's the advantage of
# describing your schema in SQLAlchemy?
#
# For as fantastic as SQLAlchemy is, using SQLAlchemy to generate schema is
# the equivalent of giving yourself a lobotomy while in the middle of
# attempting to write a Pulitzer Prize article. Why handicap yourself? Use
# SQLAlchemy for what it excels at: generating efficient SQL based on
# mappings between Python classes and database tables. Manually generated
# schema results in a few extra lines of code in a tiny number of files, but
# it goes a long ways towards clarity, predictability and
# explicitness. Automatic schema migrations, you say? l2dba or gtfo.
#
# Re: PostgreSQL vs other RDBMS'es. Here's another piece of hard earned
# knowledge from my last 14yrs of dorking with countless websites and
# databases: portability to other relational databases is a straw man
# argument. PostgreSQL is faster, more stable, the most standards conformant
# relational database, is ridiculously feature rich and cheaper to operate
# than its alternatives (both in terms of operations and efficiency on
# hardware), and that's the short list of reasons. If you are building a
# website, I am unable to produce a single fact based, data driven argument
# to use MySQL[1]. Hiring? Training?  Replication? Feh, that's FUD. Please
# stop perpetrating harm on your own organization and applications by
# succumbing to unfounded beliefs and lemmingism.
#
# [1] There are three situations where I would use a different relational
# database. The first two situations are: 1) if my target hosting platform
# did not support SystemV shared memory, or 2) I am architecting something
# for an embedded or mobile device. In the former case, I'd change hosting
# providers or would fire my system administrator, and in the latter, I'd use
# SQLite. What's the third case? The answer is DB2, but what's the question?

# Models are added to the db's metadata when create_app() is actually called.
